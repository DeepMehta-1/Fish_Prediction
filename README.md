## Fish Prediction
*This project intends to classify the different species of fish based on the fish information*

For this project we have used the Fish dataset which is available on: https://www.kaggle.com/aungpyaeap/fish-market

**Information about the attributes:**
Weight of Fish(g):  Enter weight of the the fish in gram. 
Vertical Length(cm):  Enter vertical length in cm.
Diagonal Length(cm):  Enter diagonal length in cm.
Cross Lenght(cm); Enter cross length in cm.
Hight(cm):  Enter hight in cm.
Diagonal Width(cm): Enter diagonal length in cm.

The dataset includes 159 Rows and 7 columns(1 is dependent variable - species)

**Since species prediction is a classfication based problem hence supervised learning algorithm is used. Hence, for making prediction I have used Logistics Regression algorithm.**

**Types of species dataset has:** 1) Bream, 2) Parkki, 3) Perch, 4) Pike, 5) Roach, 6) Smelt, 7) Whitefish
